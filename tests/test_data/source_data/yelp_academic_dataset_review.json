Z Cucina is probably my favorite happy hour in the Grandview area. We drop by somewhat often for happy hour on Thursday, when they have a variety of flatbreads for $5 each. They're bigger than your average flatbread- I certainly can't eat an entire one myself- and are consistently delicious, even when I initially question some of the seasonal combinations (prosciutto and peach gave me pause, but we've gone back and gotten three more, so that says something.) Aside from the Thursday flatbreads, the food specials on happy hour aren't what I would necessarily call \"cheap\" but they're usually pretty fantastic. Coupled with excellent drink specials ($5 martinis or wine, $3 beer) I think it's an excellent value for the money. Service is almost always great; the bartenders are friendly without being overly intrusive. We left a to-go bag one night and I went back to see if there was any chance they hadn't pitched it yet; Rick met me at the door with it. Much appreciated.","useful":0,"user_id":"3tLQj8SG252NTwM-vr569A"}

It was decent but reminded me of the chocolate muffins from Sams club.  I ordered the short ribs as  my main course and the kids each ordered the mini cheeseburgers. My meal had zero flavor, even with cheese grits. It was supposed to have carrots in it and I think I had one.  Absolutely not worth the  $23.  The mini cheeseburgers were nothing to write home about.  Thank goodness the fries were good.\n\nThe other thing that really annoyed me is that I ordered wine with my meal and for $9 I got maybe a 4 oz pour.  \n\nNow onto the shake. My son ordered the cookie jar shake. Basically it was a very expensive cookies and cream milkshake that was extra gritty. Very disappointed because the pictures looked amazing, but we have had much better at regular ice cream stores.\n\nMy advice is just go in for the dessert area.
